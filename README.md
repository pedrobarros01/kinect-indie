## About 🤔:

Kinect Indie is a computer vision application developed in Python that allows players to transform movements captured by a camera into keyboard inputs. Inspired by the game Jump King, the project enables intuitive interaction, where the strength of a jump is translated into the duration of the spacebar press, and the character's movement to the left or right is based on the direction of motion detected by the camera.
